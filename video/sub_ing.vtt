Welcome to SaluDic. Today we are going to talk about asthma.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.040
Asthma is a chronic disease of the airways that causes inflammation

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:21.000
and difficulty breathing. Its symptoms may include coughing, wheezing,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.920
chest tightness, and difficulty breathing due to allergies, genetic factors, or pollution.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.080
Tests such as spirometry and

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:46.040
chest x-rays are performed to diagnose asthma. Treatment includes treatments such as inhaled corticosteroids or bronchodilators.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.360
Of all these areas of Spain, the most affected is the Valencian community

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.240
with around 375,000 asthmatics. Although asthma has no cure, most

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.400
people can lead a healthy life with proper treatment.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.320
Here we leave you more information. Thank you so much.
